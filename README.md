# Private Panda

Private Panda is a script to harden Firefox's security and privacy settings.

## Installation

Copy `user.js` into your Firefox profile directory (there will be a `prefs.js` in that directory).  To prompt for profiles with Firefox, just add the `-p` command line argument.

If you'd like to completely disable JavaScript, just add `user_pref( 'javascript.enabled', false );` to `user.js`
